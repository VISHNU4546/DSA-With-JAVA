# Data Structures and Algorithms with Java

This repository contains implementations of various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using Java. It serves as a learning resource for those looking to strengthen their DSA skills and understanding of fundamental concepts in computer science.

## Features

- **Data Structures**: Implementations of key data structures (e.g., arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, heaps, graphs, etc.).
- **Algorithms**: Common algorithms for sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, and graph traversal.
- **Problem Solutions**: Solutions to popular coding problems from platforms like LeetCode, Codeforces, HackerRank, etc.
- **Time and Space Complexity**: Each implementation includes time and space complexity analysis.
